# Installing Unreal Engine Plugin

## Prerequisites

First, follow these steps to build flatbuffers:

1. Run `python ExternalTools\BuildScripts\build_flatbuffers.py`.

2. After the build is complete, make sure the files are located in the following directories:
   - `Plugins\UnrealEngine\ThirdParty\flatbuffers\include`
   - `Plugins\UnrealEngine\ThirdParty\flatbuffers\lib`

## Placing the Unreal Engine Plugin

Let's install the BocchiTracker plugin in your Unreal Engine project:

1. Copy the `Plugins\UnrealEngine\BocchiTracker` directory to `[Project Root]/Plugins/BocchiTracker`.

2. Also, copy the `Plugins\UnrealEngine\ThirdParty\flatbuffers` directory to `[Project Root]/Source/ThirdParty/flatbuffers`.

The BocchiTracker plugin has now been properly placed. For more detailed steps, refer to the [UE plugin documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en/ProductionPipelines/Plugins/).

Once the installation is complete, please ensure that the build runs successfully.

## Using the BocchiTracker Plugin
